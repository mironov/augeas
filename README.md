Augeas is a simple Chrome extension that displays the list of installed extensions that have access to your data.

It is created for illustration purposes only and doesn't claim that installed extensions are harmful in any way.

Please give each enabled extension a good hard look. Consider disabling or uninstalling extensions you may have forgotten about or ones you don't explicitly trust.
